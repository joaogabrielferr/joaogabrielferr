# About
Hey ‚úåÔ∏è, I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Instituto Federal de Educa√ß√£o, Ci√™ncia e Tecnologia do Norte de Minas Gerais. I like software development in general, especially web development, competitive programming and machine learning.
<br/>
You can reach me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaogabrielferr) or via [email](mailto:joaogabrielferr@gmail.com).
<br/>
I like to use Javascript, React, Python, C++, HTML5, CSS, SQL to build my projects, but I have also used Node.js, GraphQL, Angular, PostgreSQL and other things. I'm currently learning Typescript.
