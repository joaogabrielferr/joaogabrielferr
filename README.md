# Hey ✌️,
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Norte de Minas Gerais. I like software development in general, especially web development, competitive programming and machine learning.
<br/>
You can reach me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaogabrielferr) or via [email](mailto:joaogabrielferr@gmail.com).
<br/>
I like to use Typescript, React, HTML5, CSS to build my projects, and even tough I'm more inclined toward front-end, I have also used things like Node.js, SQL, PostgreSQL, mySQL, MongoDB and other back-end related stuff. and many other things. I'm currently learning Angular, GraphQL and Sass.
