Hi there ðŸ‘‹,<br/>
I'm currently working as a frontend dev, but I'm also into backend development. I'm currently using Node.js, but I also know Java and Spring boot, and I'm currently learning Go.
<br/>
My current stack for building anything related to the web is Angular (and Nx) or React, Node.js, Docker, Redis, Typeorm, Postgres and friends.
