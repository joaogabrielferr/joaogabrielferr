<strong>hey,</strong><br/>
I'm currently working as a frontend dev using <strong>Angular</strong> , but i also build personal projects with <strong>React</strong>. I'm also into backend development and its challanges. I use <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Spring</strong> for personal projects, and I'm currently learning <strong>Node.js</strong>. I'm also starting to get into <strong>Golang</strong>.
<br/>
My current stack for building anything related to the web is currently Angular (or React), Nx, Java, Spring and Docker.
