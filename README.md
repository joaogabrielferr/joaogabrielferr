## Hey ✌️,
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Norte de Minas Gerais.
<br/>
I like software development in general, especially web development, competitive programming and machine learning.
<br/>
You can reach me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaogabrielferr) or via [email](mailto:joaogabrielferr@gmail.com).
<br/>
<br/>
I like to use ***Typescript***, ***React***, ***HTML5*** and ***CSS*** to build my projects, and even tough I'm more inclined towards front-end development, I have also used things like Node.js, SQL, PostgreSQL, mySQL, MongoDB, Java and other back-end related stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently learning Angular, GraphQL and Sass. As for the other things, I use C++ for competitive programming 😮 and Python for machine learning 😲.
